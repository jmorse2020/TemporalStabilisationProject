# TemporalStabilisationProject
Code and simulations for stabilising an 80MHz oscillator.

The python simuation models the spectral interference between a single split pulse after it has passed through an interferometer where the arms are made of fibre and a small amount of air.
The largest impact on the output is the dispersion in the fibres, which if the path lengths are different in each arm, is seen as the higher frequency modulation toward the edges.
